## 🏗️ Project Structure

The website uses a modular architecture for enhanced security:

- **`index.html`** - Main HTML structure (376 lines, 21 KB)
- **`styles.min.css`** - Minified CSS stylesheet (24 KB)
- **`main.min.js`** - Obfuscated JavaScript (106 KB)

### Source Code Protection

To prevent unauthorized copying, the code is:
- ✅ **Split** into separate files (HTML, CSS, JS)
- ✅ **Minified** - CSS compressed to single line
- ✅ **Obfuscated** - JavaScript heavily scrambled with hexadecimal identifiers
- ✅ **Copyright Protected** - Legal notices in all files

See **[BUILD.md](BUILD.md)** for complete documentation on:
- How code is obfuscated
- Building production files
- File structure
- Security benefits
- Maintenance procedures

### Development vs Production
